Hello,

My name is tt3rror, and I am a white hat hacker. I develop scripts intended for penetration testing, which I offer free of charge for public use. I do not endorse any illegal activities, and I cannot be held responsible for how my code may be utilized.

Thank you.

If you want to send me an email use [this](https://github.com/tt3rror/tt3rror/blob/tt3rror%20-%20GitHub_0x72E7AC37_public.asc) pgp key to encrypt it. (I will not respond)
